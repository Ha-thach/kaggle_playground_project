# 2025 Kaggle Playground Series - Calories Burned Prediction 

## Overview
Welcome to the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series! This project is part of the ongoing monthly competitions designed to provide interesting and approachable datasets for the data science community to practice and improve their machine learning skills.

The goal of this particular challenge is to predict the number of calories burned during a workout based on various workout-related features.

## Dataset
- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing features and the target variable (calories burned).
- `test.csv`: Test dataset where the target variable is unknown, used for final predictions.
- `sample_submission.csv`: Sample submission file showing the required submission format.
- `result.csv`: File containing your model predictions (generated by your code).

## Project Files
- `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset.
- `model.py`: Python script containing the machine learning model and training code.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for managing parameters and settings.
- `readme.md`: This documentation file.

## Objective
Build and train machine learning models to accurately predict calories burned during workouts using the given dataset features. The predicted calories should be submitted in the required format for evaluation.

## Getting Started
1. Explore the data using `EDA.ipynb` to understand feature distributions and relationships.
2. Preprocess and clean the data as necessary.
3. Train models using the code in `model.py`.
4. Generate predictions on the test set and save them in `result.csv`.
5. Submit your predictions according to the competition guidelines.

## How to Run
- Run the Jupyter notebook `EDA.ipynb` for data exploration.
- Use `model.py` to train and evaluate your model.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
